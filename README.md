# Complex Numbers

Complex numbers and respective operations implemented in C#.

Adapted the code from my "Fractal-Megacollection" repository, which was in Cg. Put it in a struct, added operators, etc.

Uses doubles.

# Contains

	Multiply
	Divide
	Add
	Subtract
	Sqrt
	Abs
	SquaredAbs
	Conjugate
	Inverse

## Operators
	== != < > + - / *
Operators implement proper Divide/Multiply methods, so you can do 
	
	Complex * Complex

instead of

	Complex.Multiply(Complex)

## Properties
	public Complex conjugate
	public Complex inverse
	public Complex sqrt
	public double squaredAbs
	public double abs
	public bool isReal
